        Open Places is an innovative app designed to provide you with real-time information about
        open establishments in your desired area. By pinging your location, the app delivers a
        comprehensive list of all the nearby places that are currently open. Whether you're looking
        for options within half a mile or up to five miles, Open Places adapts to your location.

        The inspiration for this app came from my experiences with my wife and our young son. As we
        took walks with him in his stroller, our schedule would vary depending on his sleep
        patterns. We often encountered the frustration of arriving at cafes that were still an hour
        away from opening or finding that the library had different hours for no apparent reason.
        Google's "open now" button required too many clicks to find what we needed. <br />
        <br />
        The data in this app is currently hard-coded. Google's Places API requires separate calls
        for nearby places and place details, so during development, I manually added and seeded 30
        restaurants, bars, museums, libraries, parks, and more. The code includes a switch to
        integrate Google's Places API, which would allow for real-time data retrieval with minimal
        effort. Once in production, decisions about the app's API budget allocation would be made,
        prioritizing features such as "opening soon" notifications tailored to your schedule. To
        keep costs down, the app currently provides extra details only for your favorite places, but
        there are opportunities to make this cost-effective while still providing an exciting user
        experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the data is currently hard-coded, you can still customize your default latitude,
        longitude, search radius, and favorite categories. This way, when we transition to the API,
        you'll have all your preferred options readily available. Enjoy the convenience of Open
        Places! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to jdelbalzo99@gmail.com.
